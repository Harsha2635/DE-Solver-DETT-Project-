# DE-Solver-DETT-Project-
1)Analytical method 

2)Numerical methods for solving the equation.

3)Fourier analysis .

4)Analysis by varying R,L,alpha .

5)How we optimize the codes .

6)Report. 

The solution for the given square wave can be executed by diff numerical methods in the "DESolver" folder

The Report can be accessed via pdf  - "report.pdf"

The section Plot analysis compares the solution of all the methods 

The folder Fourier Analysis has the .py file which reads the .so file and plots 

You can find the analysis of varying R L and alpha in the folder "R_L_Alpha_Analysis"

All the output figures obtained are in the folder "figs"

The codes for each numerical method are in both .py and .c, but .c is more effient as it generates a .so file and the question in .py reads the .so file instead of directing writing the function in c 

The functions for munerical methods are written in .c and then plotted in python, why we found to be the fastest way 

The stability analysis for each method is written in the section 'report.pdf/Stability Analysis'

The work in this repo is a collaborative work of all the members in the group
